"BEHIND YOU."  
"TO YOUR RIGHT."  
"IN FRONT OF YOU."  
"YES"
"NO"  
"PRESS BUTTON OR <RETURN> TO CONTINUE"  
"THIS DIRECTION WILL TAKE YOU BACK INTO THE WILDERNESS. DO YOU STILL WANT TO GO THIS WAY?"
"YOU TRIP ON A WIRE TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF BELLS TINKLING. AFTER A MOMENT THERE IS A COMMOTION AHEAD OF YOU."
"FLEE"
"ADVANCE CAUTIOUSLY"
"ATTACK"  
"YOU CHARGE INTO A GROUP OF SCRUFFY LOOKING NOMADS."  
"A GROUP OF NOMADS SPOT YOU. THEY SHOUT AND CHARGE. AS THEY COME CLOSER THEIR NUMBERS SWELL WITH ARRIVALS."
"THE HEROIC DEATHS OF THOSE YOU HAVE JUST BATTLED HAS BOUGHT TIME FOR THE HEADMAN TO RALLY HIS PEOPLE. WITH A TREMENDOUS CRY HE LEADS HIS TRIBE INTO BATTLE."
"A CROWD OF SCRUFFY LOOKING NOMADS GATHERS AS HIDDEN SENTRIES GIVE WORD OF YOUR APPROACH. THERE ARE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN."
"ALL THE NOMADS HOLD THEIR SWORDS AT THE READY, WATCHING YOU WARILY. MORE NOMADS APPEAR FROM OUT OF TENTS IN THE CAMP."

". WILL YOU JOIN US?'"  
"'THEN YOU MUST LEAVE US,' HE RESPONDS WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS HE CAN MUSTER. DO YOU LEAVE?"
"'YOUR INSULTS ARE TOO MANY! KILL THEM!'"  
"'YOU MUST BE TIRED FROM YOUR TRAVELS. WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH LODGING.' HE LEADS THE WAY TO A HUT WHICH IS HURRIEDLY BEING CLEARED OF ITS OCCUPANTS."
"'HERE YOU MAY REST.'"  
"THE HEADMAN WALKS UP TO YOU WITH HIS GUARDS. 'GOOD MORNING. THERE ARE CELEBRATIONS PLANNED TODAY.'"
"'COME, LET THERE BE GAMES FOR OUR GUESTS.' HE LEADS YOU TO THE CAMP'S CENTRAL CLEARING."
"YOU ARE TREATED AS HONORED GUESTS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. THERE ARE CONTESTS OF STRENGTH AND SKILL IN YOUR HONOR."
"AS NIGHT FALLS, THE NOMADS BUILD A HUGE CAMPFIRE IN THE CENTER OF THE CAMP. THE WHOLE TRIBE GATHERS FOR THE FEAST. AFTER THE FEAST THERE IS DANCING AND WILD CELEBRATIONS."
"DURING THE FESTIVITIES THE CHIEF (HIS TONGUE LOOSENED BY DRINK) TELLS YOU OF THE DANGERS OF THE REGION. YOU MAKE HASSAD AHWAL'S TALK ENTRY 55 IN YOUR JOURNAL."
"THE HEADMAN SEEMS VERY UNEASY AS HE CONTINUES TO SPEAK. HE PRACTICALLY BEGS YOU TO STAY FOR A FEW MORE DAYS, RATHER THAN LEAVE IN THE MORNING AS YOU PLANNED."
"'MY SCOUTS HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF A LARGE BAND OF KOBOLDS IN THE VICINITY. I WORRY ABOUT MY PEOPLE. IF YOU WOULD STAY UNTIL THEY PASS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT."
"'PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT OVERNIGHT.' AFTER A WHILE THE FESTIVITIES END AND YOU ARE ESCORTED TO YOUR LODGING. "
"A GUARD APPEARS BEFORE YOU, 'YOU MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. ALLOW ME TO ESCORT YOU TO YOUR LODGING.'"
"FOLLOW THE GUARD"
"ATTACK THE GUARD"  
"AS THE GUARD TURNS TO ESCORT YOU BACK TO YOUR TENT, YOU SMILE AND STICK HIM IN THE BACK. WITH A CHOKED CRY HE COLLAPSES."

"THE HEADMAN COMES TO YOU AND SAYS, 'ABOUT MY REQUEST OF LAST NIGHT, WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?'"
"STAY AND FIGHT"
"LEAVE"  
"LOOKING DISAPPOINTED THE HEADMAN SAYS, 'GOOD LUCK IN YOUR TRAVELS.'"  
"'I AND MY PEOPLE THANK YOU. AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE HONOR. YOU SHALL BE RICHLY REWARDED FOR YOUR GENEROUS AID.'"
"'YOU MAY WANDER AS YOU WILL OR YOU MAY STAY HERE AND REST AND STUDY. FORGIVE ME, I MUST SEE TO MY PEOPLE.' HE LEAVES."
"THE SOUND OF WAR CRIES DRAWS YOU OUT OF THE HUT. "  
"A HORDE OF KOBOLDS IS ATTACKING THE CAMP. A LONE SENTRY CHARGES BUT IS QUICKLY CUT DOWN. A FAMILY EMERGES FROM A HUT AND CHARGES THE KOBOLDS."
"AHEAD YOU SEE A LARGE GROUP OF KOBOLDS ENGAGED IN MELEE WITH SOME NOMADS. " 
"THE NOMADS SEE YOU AND SHOUT, 'THE FILTHY TRAITORS! GET THEM!' THE KOBOLDS, SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY, JOIN WITH THEM."
"YOU SEE A HUGE GROUP OF KOBOLDS MOVING RELUNCTANTLY FORWARD UNDER THE CURSES OF THEIR LEADER. THE HEADMAN WALKS UP AND SLAPS YOU ON THE BACK."
"'WELL DONE! WHAT SAY WE FINISH THIS TOGETHER?'"  
"DESTROY THE KOBOLDS"
"FLEE"  
"THE HEADMAN SNEERS, 'COWARDS!' HE TURNS TO THE TWO GUARDS STILL LIVING AND YELLS, 'FOR HYRNKA!' HE AND HIS TWO GUARDS CHARGE INTO THE PACK."
"AS THEY REACH THE PACK A FLURRY OF ARROWS STRIKE THEM. UNDAUNTED THEY STRIKE. KOBOLDS DIE LIKE FLIES AROUND THESE HEROES. A GUARD FALLS WITH A SCORE OF WOUNDS."
"WITHIN TEN MINUTES THE KOBOLDS BREAK, HALF THEIR NUMBER DEAD. THE CHIEF COMES BACK, 'I PROMISED YOU REWARD FOR YOUR AID. SO IT SHALL BE... EQUAL TO YOUR HONOR.'"
"'NOW LEAVE. WE HAVE OUR WOUNDED TO LOOK TO.'"  
"'THEN LET US DO IT!'"  
"THE SHAMAN WALKS UP TO YOU. 'YOU FOUGHT AS THE HEROES OF LEGEND. A REWARD WAS PROMISED AND SO SHALL IT BE.'"
"'NOW PLEASE LEAVE US TO OUR MOURNING. IT IS A PERSONAL THING FOR OUR PEOPLE.'"
"A HORDE OF KOBOLDS IS ATTACKING THE CAMP."  
"ADVANCING ON YOU IS A LARGE BAND OF KOBOLDS WITH BLOOD LUST IN THEIR EYES." 
"YOU SEE A HUGE GROUP OF KOBOLDS MOVING RELUNCTANTLY FORWARD UNDER THE CURSES OF THEIR LEADER."
"JUST AS YOU THINK YOURSELVES FREE OF DANGER, THE HEADMAN, HIS SHAMAN AND GUARDS ATTACK WITH CRIES OF 'FOUL TRAITORS!' AT THE SAME TIME KOBOLDS ATTACK."
